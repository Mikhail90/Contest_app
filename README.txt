Contest App.

This app is my first major attempt at a project in rails. 

This app is designed to allow:

Administrative users:
  - To log in
  - To create a Contest
  - To view user submissions
  - To delete a Contest (This will only remove it from the landing page),
  
End users:
  - To enter a contest
  - To opt into partner programs
  

  Note: Dates are going to be in DD/MM/YYYY
  


Version information:




User Authentication Commit:
(Date: 12/04/2013)
The user authentication was done for the CSR app and has simply been added to this project. It uses ByCrypt to encrypt and store the password. 



Initial Commit: 
	This only has the data model set up, for the relationships between contests, 	contestants, prizes and opt-in partners
	

Upcoming:
	Administrative user authentication

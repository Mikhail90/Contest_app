Contest App.

This app is my first major attempt at a project in rails. 

This app is designed to allow:

Administrative users:
  - To log in
  - To create a Contest
  - To view user submissions
  - To delete a Contest (This will only remove it from the landing page),
  
End users:
  - To enter a contest
  - To opt into partner programs
  
  


Version information:

Initial Commit: 
	This only has the data model set up, for the relationships between contests, 	contestants, prizes and opt-in partners
	

Upcoming:
	Administrative user authentication
